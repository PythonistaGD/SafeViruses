Hello! This is my GitHub responsitory for all the safe viruses I made all using Python. **Do not use these for any malicious purposes.** I am not responsible for the malwares you create.

`melting.py` -- A safe recreation of the email worm **Melting.exe**, but this version does not spread itself! It is just a nice screensaver. Close via task manager.

And this is currently all there is. I will upload more as the days continue.
